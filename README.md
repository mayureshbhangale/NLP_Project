Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death causing more than 8 lakh deaths per year and even more suicide attempts. The phenomenon of an individual having suicidal thoughts is called suicidal ideation and to seek out and help these individuals is suicidal ideation detection. Although much research has been conducted on the assessment and management of individuals on the risk of committing suicide, what these research papers lack is the analysis of real time data and therefore fails to provide medical or psychological help. We set to tackle both these problems, firstly by increasing the incoming data and collecting data from an environment which is more effective than any other surveys. We coined this as seeking out the virtual suicide notes. This led us to a platform like reddit, which creates a same and anonymous place for the user to express without any animosity. In this project we will be using machine learning based classifiers for suicide detection like TF-IDF and CNN.
